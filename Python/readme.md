### 1. Which of the following statements is true about Python variables?
- **Answer**: Python variables do not need to be declared before use.

### 2. As a follow-up to Q1, which of the following is a correct variable name in Python?
- **Answer**: `variable1`

### 3. Mention two ways by which you can apply comments in Python.
- **Answer**:
  1. Use the `#` symbol for single-line comments.
  2. Use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line comments.

### 4. What is the difference between the `input()` function and the `print()` function in Python?
- **Answer**:
  - `input()` is used to take input from the user.
  - `print()` is used to display output to the user.

### 5. How do you convert the string `'123'` to an integer in Python?
- **Answer**: `int('123')`

### 6. Differentiate between the following operators:
- **Answer**:
  - `=` is the assignment operator; `==` is used for comparison.
  - `/` performs division; `%` returns the remainder of the division.
  - `/` returns a floating-point result; `//` returns an integer result (floor division).
  - `*` performs multiplication; `**` raises to the power (exponentiation).

### 7. What is the output of the following Python code?
```
a = int(input("Enter a:"))
a = 20
b = 10
print(a + b)
```
- Answer: The output will be `30` because a is overwritten with `20`.

### 8. What is the output of the following Python code?
```
a = "nana "
b = 8
c = a * b
print(c, "Batman")
```
- Answer: The output will be `nana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana Batman`

### Question 9 to 13 are in codes

### 14. Evaluate the following expressions:
```
(a<b) or (not(c==b) and (c<a))
 a. a =10, b=5, c=0
 b. a=1.21, b=1.20, c=1.22
```

- (a<b) or (not(c==b) and (c<a)) evaluates to:
    - a = 10, b = 5, c = 0 → True
    - a = 1.21, b = 1.20, c = 1.22 → False

### Q14 & 15 are in codes

### 17. Arithmethic expression evaluation
a. `-7*20+8/16*2+54` → -140 + 1 + 54 = -85

b. `7**2//9%3` → 49 // 9 = 5, 5 % 3 = 2

c. `(7-4*2)*10-25*8//5` → (7 - 8) * 10 - 200 = -10 - 40 = -50

d. `5%10+10-25*8//5` → 5 + 10 - 200 // 5 = 15 - 40 = -25

### 18.Evaluate the following expressions involving relational and logical operators:
  a. `'hi' > 'hello' and 'bye' < 'Bye'` → False
  b. `'hi' > 'hello' or 'bye' < 'Bye'` → True
  c. `7 > 8 or 5 < 6 and 'I am fine' > 'I am not fine'` → True
  d. `10 != 9 and 29 >= 29` → True
  e. `10 != 9 and 29 >= 29 and 'hi' > 'hello' or 'bye' < 'Bye' and 7 <= 2.5` → False
  f. `5 % 10 + 10 < 50 and 29 >= 29` → True
  g. `7 ** 2 <= 5 // 9 % 3 or 'bye' < 'Bye'` → False
  h. `5 % 10 < 8 and -25 > 1 * 8 // 5` → False
  i. `7 ** 2 // 4 + 5 > 8 or 5 != 6` → True
  j. `7/4 < 6 and 'I am fine' > 'I am not fine'` → False
  k. `10 + 6 * 2 ** 2 != 9//4 - 3 and 29 >= 29/9` → True
  l. `'hello' * 5 > 'hello' or 'bye' < 'Bye'` → False
